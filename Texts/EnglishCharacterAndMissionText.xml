“Once, humans launched a satellite called the 'Bird Ship.' If it were still operational, its distance from Earth would also be 380,000 kilometers.”
“The Bird Ship was equipped with a variety of plants and animals, along with an optimized ecosystem to observe their adaptability in space. This ecological experiment was in preparation for future terraforming of extraterrestrial environments.”
“Later, due to an unknown mechanical failure, it became space junk and remained forever at the Trojan point, forming an equilateral triangle with Earth and the Moon.”
“People spent a fortune, only to create a relic isolated in space, which later generations called the 'Bird Ship Ruins.'”
