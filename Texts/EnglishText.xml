  <eventtext.youmujoin.c1>"Again at a noisy station, erratic crowds, and this fucking headache..." you think, as you pop through the outpost's airlock\n\nHowever, as you climb up the ladder and enter the station, a very strange sense of dissonance makes you look behind.\n\nThe source of this seems to be a young girl with her eyes closed... as if meditating. Definitely not something you'd expect to see in this place, as this girl looks about 15 years old, her delicate face surpasses the most exaggerated propaganda of Europa Coalition for their leaders, and her silver hair makes you inexplicably think of the light reflected from the ship's porthole. \n\nAfter shaking your head and letting go of "that thought", you notice that she wears two sword scabbards around her waist, despite both being empty. \n\nYou can't help but wonder, "what the fuck is such a girl doing in THIS place?"</eventtext.youmujoin.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.o1>Step closer to have a look at her</eventtext.youmujoin.o1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c2>You are about to approach, but the seemingly unprepared girl raises her head first. \n\nAt that moment, you manage to get a glimpse of a sword ———— different from the boarding axes stained with rusty blood used by security officers, or ceremonial swords decorated with striped ribbons by assistants. This particular sword feels like a weapon that could not be controlled by mere people, but makes you feel it has been honed in countless years of training after being extracted from the coldness of the vast ocean.\n\nFor a moment, you feel like you and the outpost you're in have been cut in half in a single strike, making you choke on your own air, even if the scabbards she is wearing are empty. \n\n"Hello. Do you happen to have a watermelon, please?" \nThe girl's voice was just like you imagined it: clear, but with a hint of sonority, like a sharp sword cutting through cherry bloss- wait... watermelon?</eventtext.youmujoin.c2>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.o2>"A watermelon?"</eventtext.youmujoin.o2>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3>"I don't blame if you don't know it, it's new here. A kind of spherical fruit, green on the outside, and black stripes on it... Could you help me find one?" The girl makes a somewhat embarrassing request to you. \n\nAfter coming back to your senses ———— the girl in front of you speaks better than you thought.</eventtext.youmujoin.c3>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.o3>Find out if you have anything she wants on you.</eventtext.youmujoin.o3>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c1>You do happen to have a watermelon on you, and the girl seems quite happy. However, she quickly frowns again, as if wondering how to speak. \n\n"Thank you. Truth be told, I lost my way while chasing that damned rabbit, and I don't know where I am now... could you give me a ride? I'll work if you need me to."</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o1>"It'd be my honor, Miss Youmu Konpaku."</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o1.c1>The girl looks relieved. You hear a very excited "Thank you!" as you watch her run towards your submarine. But, wait... did she tell you her name?</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o1.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o2>"I'm sorry, but we're already full."</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o2>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o2.c1>You definitely wouldn't allow such a young girl on a trip as dangerous as this, but this is Youmu! How can we not let her join us? Is it even possible that someone would refuse her with such coldness?</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.o2.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2>After some searching, it seems that you don't have any watermelon on you. Looking up, the girl is waiting for your answer.</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2.o1>"Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have what you want here. But I can try to find one..."</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2.o1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2.c1>The girl sighs slightly and stops paying attention to you. "What should I do? Yuyuko sama will..." As you left, you seemed to hear her muttering something. Maybe the outpost vending machines could have one of these fruits?</eventtext.youmujoin.c3.c2.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin_return.c1>With the sense of dissonance on her, you easily find the girl at the outpost again.</eventtext.youmujoin_return.c1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin_return.o1>"Missy, I got the watermelon you asked for..."</eventtext.youmujoin_return.o1>
  <eventtext.youmujoin_return.o1.c2>You wanted to say that, but suddenly it occurred to you that you didn't actually have a watermelon with you.</eventtext.youmujoin_return.o1.c2>
  <eventtext.youmujoin_return.o2>Don't disturb her.</eventtext.youmujoin_return.o2>
